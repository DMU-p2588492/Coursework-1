  <h2 class="CharacterNames">Alan</h2>
  <p class="AboutActors">Alan Garner is the son of Sid and Linda Garner, brother of Tracy Garner and brother-in-law of Doug Billings. He is the odd one out throughout the film. Alan is considered by other people to be while a child at heart. Although he is very immature, he never swears except on two occasions. Even at 41 until his marriage, he used to live at home with his parents as he has his dad pay his rent and his mother calls him "Sweetie".</p>

<section class="StuSection">
  <img class="Stu" src="img\stu.jpg" alt="Stu">
  <h2 class="CharacterNames">Stu</h2>
  <p class="AboutActors">Stu is the responsible, uptight, worried, a coward, and wimpy member of the Wolfpack. He is a dentist, ( and dentists are doctors) but some ignorant people don't consider him a doctor. Stu really doesn't drink that much, apart from vodka. He is the most crazy out of the Wolfpack during their drunken nights. One time when he was drunk, he even pulled out his own tooth to win a bet against Alan who betted Stu that he wasn't a good enough dentist to be able to pull out his tooth.</p>

<section class="DougSection">
  <img class="Doug" src="img\doug.jfif" alt="Doug">
  <h2 class="CharacterNames">Doug</h2>
  <p class="AboutActors">Douglas "Doug" Billings is best friends with Phil and Stu, and the brother-in-law of Alan, with whom he also shares a friendship. He is the most mild-mannered of the Wolfpack. His bachelor party trip to Las Vegas is the basis of The Hangover, although he is "lost" for the majority of the movie as the other three guys are searching for him. Stu finally puts the pieces together and figures out that they locked Doug up on the roof of Caesar's Palace, where he gets severely sunburned with no shade in the desert heat. They end up getting him back "better late than never" to his wedding, where he is forced to get married with a beet-red sunburned face.</p>
